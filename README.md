# BitmovinAnalyticsCollector

Instruments adaptive streaming video players and collects information to be sent to the Bitmovin Analytics service.

To get started collecting data with Bitmovin Analytics you need a License-Key which you can get for free by signing up for a [free Bitmovin account](https://bitmovin.com/dashboard/signup).

## Supported Platforms

- iOS 14.0+
- tvOS 14.0+

## Supported Video Players

- [Bitmovin Player](https://github.com/bitmovin/bitmovin-player-ios-sdk-cocoapod)
- AVPlayer
- [Amazon IVS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/userguide/player-ios.html)

## Example

The following example creates a BitmovinAnalytics object and attaches an AVPlayer instance to it.

```swift
// Create a BitmovinAnalyticsConfig using your Bitmovin analytics license key and/or your Bitmovin Player Key
let config:BitmovinAnalyticsConfig = BitmovinAnalyticsConfig(key:"YOUR_ANALYTICS_KEY",playerKey:"YOUR_PLAYER_KEY")
let config:BitmovinAnalyticsConfig = BitmovinAnalyticsConfig(key:"YOUR_ANALYTICS_KEY")

// Create a AVPlayerCollector object using the config just created (for the Bitmovin Player, create a BitmovinPlayerCollector)
analyticsCollector = AVPlayerCollector(config: config);

// Attach your player instance
analyticsCollector.attachPlayer(player: player);

// Detach your player when you are done.
analyticsCollector.detachPlayer()
```

### Optional Configuration Parameters

```swift
config.cdnProvider = CdnProvider.akamai
config.customData1 = "customData1"
config.customData2 = "customData2"
config.customData3 = "customData3"
config.customData4 = "customData4"
config.customData5 = "customData5"
config.customerUserId = "customUserId"
config.experimentName = "experiement-1"
config.videoId = "iOSHLSStatic"
config.path = "/vod/breadcrumb/"
config.isLive = true
config.ads = true
```

## Installation

To add the `BitmovinAnalyticsCollector` as a dependency to your project, you have two options: Using CocoaPods or Swift Package Manager.
We provide our collector for platform `iOS: 14.0+` and `tvOS: 14.0+`

## Using [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/)

Swift Package Manager is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift frameworks. It integrates with the Swift build system to automate the process of downloading, compiling, and linking dependencies.

Swift Package Manager support since `2.8.0`

We provide three products:
- `BitmovinPlayerCollector` including BitmovinPlayer v3 Collector
- `AVPlayerCollector` including AVPlayer Collector
- `AmazonIVSPlayerCollector` including Amazon IVS Player Collector

### Using Xcode

To integrate using Xcode 13, open your Project file and specify it in Project > Package Dependencies using the following URL:

```
https://github.com/bitmovin/bitmovin-analytics-collector-ios
```
### Using `Package.swift`

To integrate using Apple's Swift Package Manager, add the following as a dependency to your `Package.swift` and replace `Version Number` with the desired version of the SDK.
```
.package(name: "BitmovinAnalytics", url: "https://github.com/bitmovin/bitmovin-analytics-collector-ios", .exact("Version Number"))
```
And then specify the `BitmovinAnalytics` as a dependency of the desired target. Here is an example of a `Package.swift` file:
```
let package = Package(
  ...
  dependencies: [
    ...
    .package(name: "BitmovinAnalytics", url: "https://github.com/bitmovin/bitmovin-analytics-collector-ios", .exact("Version Number"))
  ],
  targets: [
    .target(
      name: "<NAME_OF_YOUR_PACKAGE>",
      dependencies: [
        .product(name: "BitmovinPlayerCollector", package: "BitmovinAnalytics"),
        .product(name: "AVPlayerCollector", package: "BitmovinAnalytics")
        .product(name: "AmazonIVSPlayerCollector", package: "BitmovinAnalytics")
      ]),
  ]
  ...
)
```
### Limitation
Executing `swift build` from the command line is currently not supported. Open the Package in Xcode if you are developing another Package depending on `BitmovinAnalytics`.

### Import BitmovinAnalyticsCollector into your Code

We have split the `BitmovinAnalytics` into 3 targets
- CoreCollector - including shared code for all collectors
- BitmovinPlayerCollector - including `BitmovinPlayer` Collector
- AVPlayerCollector - including `AVPlayer` Collector
- AmazonIVSPlayerCollector - including `AmazonIVSPlayer` Collector

if you are working with our Collectors you need to add at least `import CoreCollector` as many Classes are relocated to that package

Going further you need to import the corresponding Collector package for player

Example when using BitmovinPlayer
```
import CoreCollector
import BitmovinPlayerCollector
```

## Using [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/)

We depend on `cocoapods` version `>= 1.4`. 
To install it, check which Player/version you are using and add the following lines to your Podfile:

### Bitmovin Player v3

The collector for the Bitmovin Player has a dependency on `BitmovinPlayer` version `>= 3.35.0`.

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/bitmovin/cocoapod-specs.git'
pod 'BitmovinAnalyticsCollector/Core', '2.11.0'
pod 'BitmovinAnalyticsCollector/BitmovinPlayer', '2.11.0'
pod 'BitmovinPlayer', '3.0.0'

use_frameworks!
```

### AVPlayer

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/bitmovin/cocoapod-specs.git'
pod 'BitmovinAnalyticsCollector/Core', '2.11.0'
pod 'BitmovinAnalyticsCollector/AVPlayer', '2.11.0'

use_frameworks!
```

### AmazonIVSPlayer

The collector for the Amazon IVS Player has a dependency on `AmazonIVSPlayer` version `1.18.0`.

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/bitmovin/cocoapod-specs.git'
pod 'BitmovinAnalyticsCollector/Core', '2.11.0'
pod 'BitmovinAnalyticsCollector/AmazonIVSPlayer', '2.11.0'
pod 'AmazonIVSPlayer', '1.18.0'

use_frameworks!
```

Then, in your command line run

```ruby
pod install
```

## Known Issues

- The `audioCodec` property is not collected at the moment, as the information isn't available in the player.
- `subtitleLanguage` will fallback to the `label`, if no language is defined.
