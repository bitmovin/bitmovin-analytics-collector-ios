# BitmovinAnalyticsCollector

Instruments adaptive streaming video players and collects information to be sent to the Bitmovin Analytics service.

To get started collecting data with Bitmovin Analytics you need a License-Key which you can get for free by signing up for a [free Bitmovin account](https://bitmovin.com/dashboard/signup).

## Supported Platforms

- iOS 14.0+
- tvOS 14.0+

## Supported Video Players

- [Bitmovin Player](https://github.com/bitmovin/bitmovin-player-ios-sdk-cocoapod)
- AVPlayer

## Example

The following example creates a BitmovinAnalytics object and attaches an AVPlayer instance to it.

```swift
// Create a BitmovinAnalyticsConfig using your Bitmovin analytics license key and/or your Bitmovin Player Key
let config:BitmovinAnalyticsConfig = BitmovinAnalyticsConfig(key:"YOUR_ANALYTICS_KEY",playerKey:"YOUR_PLAYER_KEY")
let config:BitmovinAnalyticsConfig = BitmovinAnalyticsConfig(key:"YOUR_ANALYTICS_KEY")

// Create a AVPlayerCollector object using the config just created (for the Bitmovin Player, create a BitmovinPlayerCollector)
analyticsCollector = AVPlayerCollector(config: config);

// Attach your player instance
analyticsCollector.attachPlayer(player: player);

// Detach your player when you are done.
analyticsCollector.detachPlayer()
```

### Optional Configuration Parameters

```swift
config.cdnProvider = CdnProvider.akamai
config.customData1 = "customData1"
config.customData2 = "customData2"
config.customData3 = "customData3"
config.customData4 = "customData4"
config.customData5 = "customData5"
config.customerUserId = "customUserId"
config.experimentName = "experiement-1"
config.videoId = "iOSHLSStatic"
config.path = "/vod/breadcrumb/"
config.isLive = true
config.ads = true
```

## Installation

To add the `BitmovinAnalyticsCollector` as a dependency to your project, you have two options: Using CocoaPods or Swift Package Manager.
We provide our collector for platform `iOS: 14.0+` and `tvOS: 14.0+`

## Using [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/)

Swift Package Manager is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift frameworks. It integrates with the Swift build system to automate the process of downloading, compiling, and linking dependencies.

Swift Package Manager support since `2.8.0`

We provide three products:
- `BitmovinCollector` including BitmovinPlayer v3 Collector
- `AVFoundationCollector` including AVPlayer Collector
- `AmazonIVSCollector` including Amazon IVS Player Collector

### Using Xcode

To integrate using Xcode 13, open your Project file and specify it in Project > Package Dependencies using the following URL:

```
https://github.com/bitmovin/bitmovin-analytics-collector-ios
```
### Using `Package.swift`

To integrate using Apple's Swift Package Manager, add the following as a dependency to your `Package.swift` and replace `Version Number` with the desired version of the SDK.
```
.package(name: "BitmovinAnalytics", url: "https://github.com/bitmovin/bitmovin-analytics-collector-ios", .exact("Version Number"))
```
And then specify the `BitmovinAnalytics` as a dependency of the desired target. Here is an example of a `Package.swift` file:
```
let package = Package(
  ...
  dependencies: [
    ...
    .package(name: "BitmovinAnalytics", url: "https://github.com/bitmovin/bitmovin-analytics-collector-ios", .exact("Version Number"))
  ],
  targets: [
    .target(
      name: "<NAME_OF_YOUR_PACKAGE>",
      dependencies: [
        .product(name: "BitmovinCollector", package: "BitmovinAnalytics"),
        .product(name: "AVFoundationCollector", package: "BitmovinAnalytics")
        .product(name: "AmazonIVSCollector", package: "BitmovinAnalytics")
      ]),
  ]
  ...
)
```
### Limitation
Executing `swift build` from the command line is currently not supported. Open the Package in Xcode if you are developing another Package depending on `BitmovinAnalytics`.

### Import BitmovinAnalyticsCollector into your Code

We have split the `BitmovinAnalytics` into 3 targets
- CoreCollector - including shared code for all collectors
- BitmovinCollector - including `BitmovinPlayer` Collector
- AVFoundationCollector - including `AVPlayer` Collector
- AmazonIVSCollector - including `AmazonIVSPlayer` Collector

if you are working with our Collectors you need to add at least `import CoreCollector` as many Classes are relocated to that package

Going further you need to import the corresponding Collector package for player

Example when using BitmovinPlayer
```
import CoreCollector
import BitmovinPlayerCollector
```

## Using [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/)

We depend on `cocoapods` version `>= 1.12.1`.
To install it, check which Player/version you are using and add the following lines to your Podfile:

### Bitmovin Player v3

The collector for the Bitmovin Player has a dependency on `BitmovinPlayer` version `>= 3.35.0`.

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/bitmovin/cocoapod-specs.git'
pod 'BitmovinAnalyticsCollector/Core', '2.11.0'
pod 'BitmovinAnalyticsCollector/BitmovinPlayer', '2.11.0'
pod 'BitmovinPlayer', '3.0.0'

use_frameworks!
```

### AVPlayer

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/bitmovin/cocoapod-specs.git'
pod 'BitmovinAnalyticsCollector/Core', '2.11.0'
pod 'BitmovinAnalyticsCollector/AVPlayer', '2.11.0'

use_frameworks!
```

### AmazonIVSPlayer

The collector for the Amazon IVS Player has a dependency on `AmazonIVSPlayer` version `1.18.0`.

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/bitmovin/cocoapod-specs.git'
pod 'BitmovinAnalyticsCollector/Core', '2.11.0'
pod 'BitmovinAnalyticsCollector/AmazonIVSPlayer', '2.11.0'
pod 'AmazonIVSPlayer', '1.18.0'

use_frameworks!
```

Then, in your command line run

```ruby
pod install
```

## Known Issues

- The `audioCodec` property is not collected at the moment, as the information isn't available in the player.
- `subtitleLanguage` will fallback to the `label`, if no language is defined.

### Project setup

#### Dependencies

The project has some brew, ruby and mint dependencies. To install them run the following command in your terminal:

```
brew bundle
bundle install
mint bootstrap
```

#### Install Pods
To install the Pods used by the project by running the following command from the root directory:
``` bash
bundle exec pod install
```

#### Xcode setup
Working with the project can be done by opening the `BitmovinAnalyticsCollector.xcworkspace`. This will open a workspace where all sub-projects are already included and set up.

This contains the following projects:
##### `BitmovinAnalyticsCollector`

The `BitmovinAnalyticsCollector` contains one target per collector and one corresponding target for its unit tests. Every target is also represented in a scheme.
To run the unit tests select the scheme for the desired collector and execute them.

##### `CollectorDemoApp`

The `CollectorDemoApp` contains two targets, one demo App for iOS and one demo App for tvOS. The collectors are included directly as dependencies through Xcode. This ensures that they are always built from source when working with the Demo App.

#### CI setup

The Ci is set up using fastlane and GitHub Actions. On every push, the following workflows will be executed:

- `Swiftlint`
- All unit tests will be executed
- The Demo Apps will be build as a sanity check
